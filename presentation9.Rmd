Theory of Purchasing Power Parity:
  - Exchange Rates in the Long Run  
  - Assumption 1: All goods are identical in both countries
  - Assumption 2: Trade barriers and transportation costs are low

# Exchange Rates in the Short Run

- An exchange rate is the price of domestic assets in terms of foreign assets

Supply curve for domestic assets
  - Assume amount of domestic assets is fixed 
  - Supply curve is vertical

Demand curve for domestic assets
  - Most important determinant is the relative expected return of domestic assets
  - At lower current values of the dollar, the quantity demanded of dollar assets is higher

# Shifts in the demand for domestic assets

- Domestic interest rate

- Foreign interest rate

- Expected future exchange rate

# Factors affecting the interest rate 

| Factor | Change in Factor | Assets at Each Exchange Rate | Response of Exchange Rate |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Domestic interest rate|  |  |  |
| Foreign interest rate |  |  |  |
|Expected domestic price level||||
|Expected trade barriers||||
|Expected import demand||||
|Expected export demand||||

# Changes in Interest Rates and the Exchange Rate


- When domestic real interest rates rise, the domestic currency appreciates.

- When domestic interest rates rise due to an expected increase in inflation, the domestic currency depreciates.

- Changes in the Money Supply
  - A higher domestic money supply causes the domestic currency to depreciate.

- An Increase in Expected Inflation -> rise in interest rate

Step 1. shifts the demand curve to the left...

Step 2. this leads to a fall in the exchange rate

# Applications

Application 1: The Global Financial Crisis and the Dollar

> With the start of the global financial crisis in August
2007, the dollar began an accelerated decline in value,
falling by 9% against the euro until mid-July of 2008.
After hitting an all-time low against the euro on July 11,
the value of the dollar suddenly shot upward, by over
20% against the euro by the end of October. What is
the relationship between the global financial crisis and
these large swings in the value of the dollar?

--

Application 2: Brexit and the British Pound

>As noted in the introduction, the Brexit vote in the
United Kingdom on June 23, 2016, led to nearly a 10%
depreciation in the British pound, from $1.48 to the
pound on June 23, just before the vote, to $1.36 per
pound on June 24. What explains the large one-day
decline in the exchange rate for the pound?
