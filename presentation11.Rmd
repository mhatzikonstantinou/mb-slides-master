# 8 Basic Facts 

Stocks are not the most important sources of external financing for businesses.
Issuing marketable debt and equity securities is not the primary way in which businesses finance their operations.
Indirect finance is many times more important than direct finance
Financial intermediaries, particularly banks, are the most important source of external funds used to finance businesses.

# 8 Basic Facts 

The financial system is among the most heavily regulated sectors of the economy.
Only large, well-established corporations have easy access to securities markets to finance their activities.
Collateral is a prevalent feature of debt contracts for both households and businesses.
Debt contracts are extremely complicated legal documents that place substantial restrictive covenants on borrowers.

# Problems in Financial Intermediation

Financial intermediaries have evolved to reduce transaction costs.
Economies of scale
Expertise


Assymetric Information
Adverse selection occurs before a transaction occurs.
Moral hazard arises after the transaction has developed.
Agency theory analyses how asymmetric information problems affect economic behavior.

---

# The Lemons Problem

If quality cannot be assessed, the buyer is willing to pay at most a price that reflects the average quality.
Sellers of good quality items will not want to sell at the price for average quality.
The buyer will decide not to buy at all because all that is left in the market is poor quality items.
This problem explains fact 2 and partially explains fact 1.

__Solutions__
Private production and sale of information
Free-rider problem
Government regulation to increase information
Not always works to solve the adverse selection problem, explains Fact 5
Financial intermediation
Explains facts 3, 4, & 6
Collateral and net worth
Explains fact 7


---

# Moral Hazard

Separation of ownership and control of the firm
Managers pursue personal benefits and power rather than the profitability of the firm.

Borrowers have incentives to take on projects that are riskier than the lenders would like.
This prevents the borrower from paying back the loan

__Solutions__
Monitoring (Costly State Verification)
Free-rider problem
Fact 1
Government regulation to increase information
Fact 5

Debt Contracts
Fact 1

Net worth and collateral
Incentive compatible
Monitoring and enforcement of restrictive covenants
Discourage undesirable behavior
Encourage desirable behavior
Keep collateral valuable
Provide information
Financial Intermediation
Fact 3

# Application: Developing Countries

To use property, such as land or capital, as collateral, a person must legally own it. Unfortunately, it is extremely expensive and time-consuming for the poor in developing countries to make their ownership of property legal.
When the financial system is unable to use collateral effectively, the adverse selection problem worsens because the lender needs even more information about the quality of the borrower in order to distinguish a good loan from a bad one. Little lending will take place, especially in transactions that involve collateral, such as mortgages.

- Financial Intermediation matters!
  - Is China a counterexample?

Capital Adequacy Management
Credit Risk
Interest-rate Risk

# Liquidity Management and Excess Reserves 

| Assets |  | Liabilities |  |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: |
| Reserves | $20M | Deposits | $100M |
| Loans | $80M | Bank Capital | $10M |
| Securities | $10M |  |  |

--

- The reserve ratio is 10?

- What would happen if 10 mil. deposits are removed ?

--

- What would happen if 20 mil. deposits are removed ?

--

 - Reserves are a legal requirement and the shortfall must be eliminated.

---

# Liquidity Management and Excess Reserves 

- Excess reserves are insurance against the costs associated with deposit outflows.

Borrowing:

| Assets |  | Liabilities |  |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: |
| Reserves | $9M | Deposits | $90M |
| Loans | $90M | Borrowing | $9M |
| Securities | $10M | Bank Capital | $10M |

- Cost incurred is the interest rate paid on the borrowed funds

--

Securities sale:

| Assets |  | Liabilities |  |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: |
| Reserves | $9M | Deposits | $90M |
| Loans | $90M | Bank Capital | $10M |
| Securities | $1M |  |  |

The cost of selling securities is the brokerage and other transaction costs.


--

Federal Reserve

| Assets |  | Liabilities |  |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: |
| Reserves | $9M | Deposits | $90 M |
| Loans | $90 M | Borrow from Fed | $9M |
| Securities | $10 M | Bank capital | $10 M |

Borrowing from the Fed also incurs interest payments based on the discount rate


--
Reduce loans:

| Assets |  | Liabilities |  |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: |
| Reserves | $9M | Deposits | $90 M |
| Loans | $81M | Bank Capital | $10M |
| Securities | $10M |  |  |

Reduction of loans is the most costly way of acquiring reserves.
Calling in loans antagonizes customers.
Other banks may only agree to purchase loans at a substantial discount.

# Asset Management

Three Goals:

Seek the highest possible returns on loans and securities.
Reduce risk.
Have adequate liquidity

--

Four Tools

Find borrowers who will pay high interest rates and have low possibility of defaulting.
Purchase securities with high returns and low risk.
Lower risk by diversifying.
Balance need for liquidity against increased returns from less liquid assets.

---

# Bank Management

- Liability Management

Recent phenomenon due to rise of money center banks
Expansion of overnight loan markets and new financial instruments (such as negotiable C Ds)
Checkable deposits have decreased in importance as source of bank funds.

--

- Capital Adequacy Management
  - Requirement
  - Reduces returns but decreases likelihood of default



---

# Bank Management

- Credit Risk Management
  - Screening, Monitoring
  - Long-term customer relationships
  - Loan Commitements, Covenants, Collateral
  
--

- Managing Interest-Rate Risk
  - Because interest received(loans)
  - different from interest returned(deposits)
