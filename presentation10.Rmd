# Intervention in the Foreign Exchange Market

| Federal Reserve System |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Assets |  | Liabilities |  |
| Foreign Assets | -1 Billion | Currency in Circulation | -1 Billion|
| (International Reserves) |  |  |  |

| Federal Reserve System |  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Assets |  | Liabilities |  |
| Foreign Assets | -1 Billion| Deposits with the Fed | -1 Billion |
| (International Reserves) |  | (reserves) |  |

A central bank’s purchase of domestic currency and
corresponding sale of foreign assets in the foreign
exchange market lead to an equal decline in its
international reserves and the monetary base.

--

A central bank’s sale of domestic currency to purchase
foreign assets in the foreign exchange market results in
an equal rise in its international reserves and the
monetary base.

# Sterilized foreign exchange intervention

| Federal Reserve System |  |  |  |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :---: |
| Assets |  | Liabilities |  |
| Foreign Assets (International Reserves) | -$1" "B | Monetary Base (reserves) | 0 |
| Government Bonds | +$1" "B |  |  |

To counter the effect of the foreign exchange
intervention, conduct an offsetting operation about domestic assets

- No effect on the exchange rate.

# Balance of Payments

Current Account

International transactions that involve currently
produced goods and services

Trade Balance

Capital Account

Net receipts from capital transactions

Sum of these two is the official reserve transactions
balance

Global: Should We Worry About the Large
U.S. Current Account Deficit?

Persistent trade deficits are a concern for several
reasons.

First, it indicates that, at current exchange rates, foreign
demand for U.S. exports is far less than the U.S. demand
for foreign goods.

Second, a current account deficit means that foreigners’
claim on U.S. assets is growing.

# Exchange Rate Regimes in the International Financial System 

Fixed exchange rate regime

Value of a currency is pegged relative to the value of
one other currency (anchor currency)

Floating exchange rate regime

Value of a currency is allowed to fluctuate against all
other currencies

Managed float regime (dirty float)

Attempt to influence exchange rates by buying and
selling currencies

How a Fixed Exchange Rate Regime
Works

When the domestic currency is overvalued, the central bank
must:

Purchase domestic currency to keep the exchange rate
fixed (it loses international reserves), or

Conduct a devaluation

When the domestic currency is undervalued, the central bank
must:

Sell domestic currency to keep the exchange rate fixed (it
gains international reserves), or

Conduct a revaluation
